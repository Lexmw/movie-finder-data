This project is created to utilize express servers to access and API and 
return the data to a clientutilizing a cache.
The usecase of this activity is to create a proxy express server and access information from an API
to place the information on the given client.

To complete this project you need to know:
- How to create an express server
- How to handle GET requests from the client side
- How to cache information that is passed from an API to access the information later

I hope that this is useful!
